Decision Tree: 
---
Barebones decision tree classifier. Main limitations are that it works only on numerical features and only builds decisionnodes w/ one threshold condition per node. 

Was not expecting to be as involved of a project as it turned out to be, but learned a lot about decision trees in the process and got practice using OOP, recursion, pdb, and actively considering computational complexity
